      content: `The seventh-century Tibetan king, Songtsen Gampo, is credited with introducing Buddhism to Tibet. Geomantic analysis of the land, while attempting to spread Buddhism, showed the presence of a demoness whose body lay spreadeagle across the Himalayan landscape. For Buddhism to flourish, the king built temples at various points of the demoness’ geographical body to subdue the demoness and her negative influence. The first temple, the Jokhang, was built in Lhasa on the heart of the demoness. The plan included 12 other temples: one to pin down each of the demoness’ shoulders and hips, elbows and knees, hands, and feet. Two of these were built in Bhutan - Jampa Lhakhang in Bumthang on the left knee, and Kyichu Lhakhang in Paro on the left foot. The construction of these temples is considered the earliest cultural and religious event recorded in Bhutanese history. `,
