      title: "INTRODUCTION",
      content: `The seventh-century Tibetan king, Songtsen Gampo, is credited with introducing Buddhism to Tibet. Geomantic analysis of the land, while attempting to spread Buddhism, showed the presence of a demoness whose body lay spreadeagle across the Himalayan landscape. For Buddhism to flourish, the king built temples at various points of the demoness’ geographical body to subdue the demoness and her negative influence. The first temple, the Jokhang, was built in Lhasa on the heart of the demoness. The plan included 12 other temples: one to pin down each of the demoness’ shoulders and hips, elbows and knees, hands, and feet. Two of these were built in Bhutan - Jampa Lhakhang in Bumthang on the left knee, and Kyichu Lhakhang in Paro on the left foot. The construction of these temples is considered the earliest cultural and religious event recorded in Bhutanese history. `,

Over centuries, many saints have visited and blessed these temples. Other important figures, including members of the Royal Family, have contributed to their extensions and embellishments. `,

      title: "JAMBAY LHAKHANG",
      content: `Jampa Lhakhang is located in the Choekhor valley in Bumthang, close to the west bank of the river Chamkharchhu. Built in the seventh century, the temple has been repaired and rebuilt several times. In the eighth century, under Guru Padmasambhava’s instruction, it was restored by King Sindhu of Bumthang and dedicated to the future Buddha, Jowo Jampa. There are two beliefs concerning the south-facing image of the Kalachakra and other murals: one attributes them to being commissioned by Jigme Namgyel (1825–1881) at the behest of his guru, JangchubTsondru, while the other credits the first King, Ugyen Wangchuck (1862–1926), with commissioning them in 1885 to commemorate his victory in the battle at Changlimithang. The Jampa Lhakhang Drup, an annual five-day festival honouring Guru Padmasambhava, who preached there, and commemorating the building of the temple, was started by the tertön Dorji Lingpa; the festival features the mewang (fire blessing) and tercham (naked dance) performed by monks and locals.

      title: "KYICHU LHAKHANG",
      content: `Kyichu Lhakhang in Paro was originally built in the seventh century. Over time, it has expanded through the contributions of its patrons. The principal temple contains an image of the crowned Buddha known as KyichuJowo, surrounded by images of standing bodhisattvas. It also houses an ancient statue of Buddha Shakyamuni. It is believed that Guru Padmasambhava, on a visit to the temple, had hidden treasures around it to be discovered by a future tertön. Ashi Kesang Choden Wangchuck built a Guru temple consecrated in 1971 adjacent to the old structure, where annual rites for the deities Vajrasattva, PalchenHeruka and Vajrakilaya are held under her patronage. `,
