      title: "INTRODUCTION",
      content: `Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel (1594-1651), 18th in line of prince-abbots of the Drukpa Kagyu monastery of Ralung in Southern Tibet, came to Bhutan as a refugee in 1616. A prophetic dream in which the guardian deity Mahakala appeared in its raven form is believed to have guided him on a path to Bhutan. His interactions with patrons and followers allowed him to gather support and build a strong base for the Drukpa order as he extended his political influence. Zhabdrung masterminded campaigns that repelled several Tibetan invasions while unifying regional principalities under a single administration adhering to laws based on Buddhist premises.`,
      subContent: `He created the state of Bhutan (Drukzhung) and introduced a dual system of governance, choesi nyiden, where religious and secular institutions coexisted. He built impregnable fortresses called dzongs to house monastic and administrative communities, and codified a system of rules of etiquette, driglam namzhag that continue to be followed in modern day Bhutan.`,

    politicalInfluence: {
      title: "POLITICAL INFLUENCE",
      content: `Bhutan was first unified as a political entity by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel. His campaigns repelled successive Tibetan invasions, and his popularity and political influence grew rapidly alongside his religious stature. He received tributes from across the country and from embassies from neighbouring states. Zhabdrung built many dzongs (fortresses) to guard against continuous attacks from within and outside the country. `,
      subContent: `The first dzong built in 1629 at Simtokha was followed by those at Punakha, Thimphu and Wanduephodrang. With the completion of the Paro dzong in 1645, he was able to gain complete control of western Bhutan. The campaign to subdue the eastern region began before his death and was completed by 1655. 
By the end of 1650s, the area corresponding to present day Bhutan was roughly unified as the Drukpa state.`,

    foreignTravellers: {
      title: "EARLIEST FOREIGN TRAVELLERS IN BHUTAN",
      content: `In 1627, Portuguese Jesuit monks Estevao Cacella and Joao Cabral, the first known foreign visitors to the territory of Bhutan visited the court of Zhabdrung. Cacella’s eyewitness account gives us a detailed description of Zhabdrung’s personality and reign. During their eight months in the country which they  called Cambirasi, they found Zhabdrung to be a revered, gentle, and pious ruler. `,
      subContent: `They offered him military support from their country Purdhukha (Portugal), which Zhabdrung declined. Zhabdrung enjoyed the political advantage and prestige that their presence brought him. He allowed the monks to put up a chapel for worship in Cheri monastery and gave them lamas to preach to. He promised them land in Paro to build a church, however they continued towards Tibet with no success in converting the local populace.`,

    administration: {
      title: "ADMINISTRATION CHOESI NYIDEN",
      content: `In the 17th century, Zhabdrung established choesi nyiden, a dual system of administration where religious and secular rule unified under his office. The religious aspect of the administration was governed by the reincarnate line of Je Khempos while the secular powers were given to the Druk Desi. The dual system was implemented from the numerous dzongs he built across Bhutan, each with separate wings for religious and temporal functions. Choesi nyiden is symbolised by a silken knot wrapped around a golden yoke, signifying ‘the religious law which gets tighter like a silken knot’ and the ‘secular law which gets heavier like a golden yoke’. The offices created by the Zhabdrung continue to survive today within the structure of the modern government.`,

    driglamNamzhag: {
      title: "DRIGLAM NAMZHAG",
      content: `Driglam is the way of maintaining order while namzhag means concept or system. The driglam namzhag is thus a code of etiquette and system of behaviour that follow set rules that are today part of Bhutanese identity. Drawing inspiration from the Buddhist Vinaya or monastic codes of discipline, it was codified and implemented as formal code of conduct by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel. The rules are not written but are passed down generations by example. They dictate mannerism and conduct for people in society that are elegant and proper.`,

      title: "SECRECY AT DEATH",
      content: `In 1651, at the age of 58, Zhabdrung decided to enter an indefinite spiritual retreat, confining himself in his apartment in Punakha Dzong. He was to pass away during this retreat, but his death was kept a secret for 54 years known only to members of his inner circle. The secrecy was maintained to keep the newly unified states together besides deterring Tibetans from invading. Food was passed through a hatch in the locked door of his apartment, while a procedure for visitors to present him with gifts remained.`,
      subContent: `In 1653, when the young incarnation of Pema Thinley was brought to Punakha for tonsure, someone pretending to be the Zhabdrung received gifts and tonsured him from behind the door. The young Ngawang Gyaltshen was similarly tonsured in 1662. Ritual instruments were played frequently, and orders were sent out in his name on wooden boards. During the annual migration between the summer and winter residence, a lookalike statue of Zhabdrung was carried at the head of the procession.`,
