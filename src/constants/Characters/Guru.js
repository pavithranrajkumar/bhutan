      title: "INTRODUCTION",
      content: `Guru Rinpoche, or Padmasambhava (Lotus-born), is a seminal figure in Vajrayana Buddhism and Bhutanese religious history. Considered the Second Buddha, whose coming was predicted by Shakyamuni Buddha, his life story and achievements are recorded as kathang (hagiographies). Through magical powers, he manifested into different forms to subdue negative forces that obstructed people’s enlightenment. He transmitted Buddhist teachings and tantric practices across the Himalayan region and concealed them as terma (treasures) to be discovered later by tertöns(treasure-revealers). The introduction of Buddhism in Bhutan is attributed to the Guru’s first visit in the eighth century when invited by the ailing Bumthang ruler, King Sindhu, who promised to follow the Guru’s spiritual path, in return for his health. Padmasambhava went on to impart Buddhist teachings to the king and his people.

GuruPadmasambhava, was invited to the King’s court to cure his illness. In return, the Guru asked for a consort to help him carry out his spiritual practices. King Sindhu offered his daughter, BumdenTshomo, as the Guru’s tantric consort. Retreating to a cave, the Guru meditated for seven days, ultimately subduing the chief of the spirits, Shelging Karpo, and retrieving the king’s lä.Padmasambhava then brought King Sindhu and his people under the Buddhist fold.`,
