      title: "INTRODUCTION",
      content: `Guru Rinpoche, or Padmasambhava (Lotus-born), is a seminal figure in Vajrayana Buddhism and Bhutanese religious history. Considered the Second Buddha, whose coming was predicted by Shakyamuni Buddha, his life story and achievements are recorded as kathang (hagiographies). Through magical powers, he manifested into different forms to subdue negative forces that obstructed people’s enlightenment. He transmitted Buddhist teachings and tantric practices across the Himalayan region and concealed them as terma (treasures) to be discovered later by tertöns(treasure-revealers). The introduction of Buddhism in Bhutan is attributed to the Guru’s first visit in the eighth century when invited by the ailing Bumthang ruler, King Sindhu, who promised to follow the Guru’s spiritual path, in return for his health. Padmasambhava went on to impart Buddhist teachings to the king and his people.

Kurje Lhakhang, derived from ku (body) and je (print), was built around this cave in 1652 by the third temporal ruler of Bhutan, Mingyur Tenpa (1613–1680). The KurjeTsechu (festival) is popular for its dramatised performance of the Guru’s defeat of Shelging Karpo. Two other temples within the complex were built by His Majesty Ugyen Wangchuck in 1900, and Ashi Kesang Choden Wangchuck in 1984. Kurje Lhakhang is also the final resting place of the first three kings of Bhutan. `,
