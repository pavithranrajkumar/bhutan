      content: ` The tradition of hiding treasures, Terma originated with
           Padmasambhava in the 8th century. Holy objects or scrolls with
           spiritual instructions were hidden in caves and cliffs and
           sometimes the meanings of these teachings themselves were planted
           in the minds of chosen disciples. The location and circumstances
           of their discovery are recorded as prophecies in ancient texts
           attributed to Padmasambhava. The person who was destined to reveal
           a particular treasure was called Tertön, the treasure-revealer.
           Pema Lingpa is recognized as the fourth of five Tertön Kings or
           Sovereign Tertöns, who rank among one hundred major and one
           thousand minor treasure revealers.`,
